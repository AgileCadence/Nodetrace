# Quick Start Guide

## Get up and running quickly

Its a pretty big ask to get up and running in 15 minutes and actually not possible due to the Lifecycle Services deployment time. So lets get that bit out of the way first.

#### Install Nodetrace

1. Download the latest release of Nodetrace here: [https://github.com/AgileCadence/Nodetrace/releases](https://github.com/AgileCadence/Nodetrace/releases)
2. Upload the deployable package to LCS into your asset library.
3. Deploy the package to the development server from LCS

{% hint style="info" %}
 The above steps will take a little while to complete, so whilst the code is deploying lets multitask
{% endhint %}

#### Create a new Azure Application Insights resource

The following guide will help you to setup Application Insights: [ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource](%20https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource)

### OK, so here's the 15 minute bit

You should now have the software installed and the Azure resources created. Book a slot with a member of our team for 15 minutes and we will get you licensed, connected and receiving your first data.

You need to have access to the following:

* Credit Card \(You need a subscription before you begin, but it comes complete with a 14 day trial period\)
* Access to the system you installed Nodetrace on. We need to set the configuration up in the admin area of D365
* Access to the Azure Application Insights resource in Azure

You have all the above sorted, fantastic. Now lets book an onboarding session here: [https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/AgileCadence@agilecadence.com/bookings/](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/AgileCadence@agilecadence.com/bookings/)
