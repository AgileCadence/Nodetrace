# Nodetrace

The only proactive performance monitoring tool for
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

Nodetrace does what Microsoft’s Lifecycle Services and Application Tracker can’t.
It allows you to manage your platform proactively and to identify
potential issues before they escalate.

We have built a solution that pushes performance and error data to Azure Application Insights. Key to our product is that it covers two simple concepts: it provides information on server performance; and gives metrics on web page performance. This allows you to:

> Spot trends and fix issues before they escalate
> Improve user experience
> Speed up processes
> Save time and money
